## Installation

1. Copy `horizontal-waterfall-history-card.js` to `/config/www/horizontal-waterfall-history-card/`

   e.g. ```git clone https://github.com/sxdjt/horizontal-waterfall-history-card/ /config/www```

3. Add resource in Settings > Dashboards > 3-dot-menu > Resources:
   ```
   URL: /local/horizontal-waterfall-history-card/horizontal-waterfall-history-card.js
   Type: JavaScript Module
   ```
## Basic Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:horizontal-waterfall-history-card
entity: sensor.living_room_temperature
```

## Full Configuration Options

```yaml
type: custom:horizontal-waterfall-history-card
entity: sensor.living_room_temperature
title: "Temperature History"
hours: 24
intervals: 48
height: 60
min_value: 60
max_value: 85
thresholds:
  - value: 60

show_labels: true
show_min_max: false
unit: "Â°F"
```

## Styling with Card-mod

```yaml
type: custom:horizontal-waterfall-history-card
entity: sensor.temperature
card_mod:
  style: |
    :host {
      --card-background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
      border: 2px solid var(--primary-color);
    }
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No data showing**: Check that the entity exists and has historical data
- **Card not loading**: Verify the resource is added correctly and Home Assistant restarted
- **Colors not working**: Ensure threshold values are appropriate for your sensor range
- **Performance issues**: Reduce `intervals` for longer time periods
